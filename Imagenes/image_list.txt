pendulum_gazebo:			my_1dof_robot in gazebo
pendulum_rviz_fortyfive:		my_1dof_robot in rviz with final pose 45° highlighted
pendulum_rviz_planning_fortyfive	my_1dof_robot in rviz with trajectory from 0 to 45° planned
pendulum_step_nograv:			step response with par_computado_1dof without gravity compensation, P=200,I=0,D=20
pendulum_step_grav:			same as nograv but with gravity compensation and no friction in simulation model and controller model, P=200,I=0,D=15
pendulum_step_comptorque_error:		step response which shows how the computed torque depends only on position and not on commanded velocity/acceleration
pendulum_step_effort:			step response with computed torque corrected
